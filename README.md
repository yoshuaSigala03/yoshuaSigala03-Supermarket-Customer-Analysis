### Business Questions

2. How do households with and without kids differ in spending behavior?
3. Does customer tenure affect spending or retention?
4. Which products and channels drive the most revenue?
5. How do engagement levels and marketing campaigns influence spending?

## 2. Data Preparation
### Data Understanding and Cleaning
The dataset was prepared for analysis by addressing missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies to ensure accuracy and relevance.

## 3. Data Analysis
The analysis identified significant patterns and trends in demographics, spending behavior, purchase channels, and customer engagement. High-value customer segments were also pinpointed for targeted strategies.
